This plugin allows players to buy and sell from each other using only commands to make buying and selling on your 
economy server quick and efficient!

The plugin uses a MySQL or SQLite database to store Offers and Transactions. You can configure the database type you 
wish to use in the config.yml.

By default, all offers made by players are broadcast to every player on the server. 
This can also be configured in the config.yml
